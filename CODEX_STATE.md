# Current task

Implement the live Edge health presentation contract without changing the
approved mobile layout.

## Completed

- Replaced the DOM translation observer and phrase list with keyed shell messages.
- Added EUR formatting helper and converted demo finance displays.
- Added final mobile flow and overflow guards; checked core phone layouts at
  360, 390 and 430 px without horizontal overflow.
- Recorded the site-router WireGuard architecture in `AGENTS.md`.
- Reduced `app/page.tsx` to the portal shell and moved all 19 feature screens
  into independently loaded section modules plus shared UI/data modules.
- Added Playwright coverage for all 19 sections at 360, 390 and 430 px.
- Added heading/language, interactive range and browser-error checks.
- Added a Pull Request quality workflow for lint, build and browser tests.
- Added an optional `edge` status shape to `/snapshot` and replaced the fake
  "Online · 8 sec ago" header with explicit Demo, Unknown or backend-derived
  Edge state.

## Remaining

- Run the portal test suite, review, commit, push and open the Edge-health PR.

## Tests

- `npm run lint` — passes with two existing image optimisation warnings.
- `npm test` — passes (9 tests).
- Browser inspection of primary mobile sections at 360/390/430 px — no
  document-level horizontal overflow observed.
- `npm run build:pages` — passes; `/` and `/en/` entries emitted and `og.jpg`
  is 176 KB.
- Previous portal checks passed; the Edge-health change still needs its final
  validation run on this branch.

## Known issues

- Existing image-element lint warnings remain in the Suntech About section;
  there are no lint errors.
- `npm install` reports inherited dependency audit findings; no automatic
  dependency upgrades were made in this task.

## Next action

Run lint, unit/browser tests and build; then commit and open a draft PR to
`main` for the Edge-health presentation contract.
