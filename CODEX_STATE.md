# Current task

Correct the portal's Edge data-path copy to the VPN-only Site Router topology
without changing mobile layout or runtime communication code.

## Completed

- Replaced the DOM translation observer and phrase list with keyed shell messages.
- Added EUR formatting helper and converted demo finance displays.
- Added final mobile flow and overflow guards; checked core phone layouts at
  360, 390 and 430 px without horizontal overflow.
- Recorded the site-router WireGuard architecture in `AGENTS.md`.
- Reduced `app/page.tsx` to the portal shell and moved all 19 feature screens
  into independently loaded section modules plus shared UI/data modules.
- Added Playwright coverage for all 19 sections at 360, 390 and 430 px.
- Added heading/language, interactive range and browser-error checks.
- Added a Pull Request quality workflow for lint, build and browser tests.
- Corrected the Edge gateway screen so it no longer claims direct node MQTT;
  it now shows ROCK Pi polling over OT Modbus TCP and publishing private MQTT.
- Added durable project-creator attribution in `README.md` and `CREDITS.md`.

## Remaining

- Review, push and open the Pull Request.
- Keep component-level i18n completion as a separate follow-up.

## Tests

- `npm run lint` — passes with two existing image optimisation warnings.
- `npm test` — passes (9 tests).
- Browser inspection of primary mobile sections at 360/390/430 px — no
  document-level horizontal overflow observed.
- `npm run build:pages` — passes; `/` and `/en/` entries emitted and `og.jpg`
  is 176 KB.
- `npm test` — passes (10 tests).
- `npm run test:e2e` — passes (5 Playwright tests); all 19 sections pass at
  360, 390 and 430 px without page-level horizontal overflow.
- Static build emits a separate lazy chunk for each of the 19 portal sections,
  plus small shared UI/data chunks.
- `npm run lint` — passes with the same two existing image optimisation warnings.

## Known issues

- Existing image-element lint warnings remain in the Suntech About section;
  there are no lint errors.
- `npm install` reports inherited dependency audit findings; no automatic
  dependency upgrades were made in this task.

## Next action

Commit and push the documentation/data-path correction, then continue review of
the lazy-loaded frontend Pull Request.
